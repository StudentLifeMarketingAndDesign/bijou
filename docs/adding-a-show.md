# How to add a showing to the calendar

This is just a quick guide to adding a film showing to the [Bijou Film Board](https://bijou.uiowa.edu) website calendar. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email Student Life Communications web team at imu-web@uiowa.edu.

I'm breaking this up into two parts, just to make it a bit easier.

## Adding a showing page

1. Log in to Bijou's administrative panel.

2. Click the "Calendar" page in the page list

3. Click the "Add New Show Page" 

4. Fill out the "Post Title" field with the name of the film or event.

5. Click the "Film Info" tab

6. Use the film lookup field to select a film to autofill the images, info and trailer. **Note: This field works best in Chrome or Firefox"** If the film cannot be found, that's okay. Images and info can be added later. Just ignore this step and continue to the next steps.

7. At this point **save a draft** of the new showing page by clicking the left "Save" button. This must be completed before the next steps.

8. After saving the draft, you can proceed to fill out the rest of the information and add dates to the showing.


## Adding dates and optional custom imagery/info to the showing page

After completing the above, you can add dates and custom imagery:

If the showing is an ongoing stream or something that students can access for an extended duration/access at-will, check the "Ongoing Stream" checkbox, and fill out the start and end date of the stream.

If the showing is on one or more dates, like a typical movie showing, do the following:

1. Click "Add Show Date"

2. Fill out the date field

3. In the next field, fill out each time that the showing will be, one-time-per-line.

4. Click the green "+ Create" button at the bottom

5. Repeat for any additional date and times.
